# account_views Documentation

## Overview

The `account_views.py` file defines the **views** related to **user authentication**, **password management**, and **profile management** within the application. This file implements views for common authentication tasks, such as **signing up**, **logging in**, **logging out**, and **resetting passwords**, as well as managing user profiles and comments. It utilizes Django’s **class-based views (CBVs)** to handle user interactions.

### 📌 **Key Views**
- **👤 `SignupView`**: Handles user registration, redirects authenticated users, and creates new accounts.
- **🔑 `LoginView`**: Manages user login with authentication.
- **🚪 `LogoutView`**: Logs out the authenticated user and redirects to the homepage.
- **🔒 `ForgetPasswordView` & `ResetPasswordView`**: Allows users to reset their passwords via email links.
- **👥 `ProfileUserView`**: Manages displaying and updating user profiles.
- **💬 `CommentManagementView`**: Admins can approve or delete comments and replies on user profiles.

These views provide robust user interaction mechanisms and integrate with forms, models, and background tasks to ensure smooth user experience.
