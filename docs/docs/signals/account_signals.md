# Account Signals Documentation

## Overview

The `account_signals.py` file contains **Django signals** that are used to listen for certain events or actions related to the **Comment** model. Specifically, this file includes signals for handling **post_save** and **post_delete** events when a comment or reply is created, updated, or deleted. These signals help manage the cache related to the admin profile, ensuring that the cache is always up-to-date with the most recent comments and replies.

### 📌 **Main Signal**
- **📝 update_comments_and_reply_cache** → A signal receiver that listens to `post_save` and `post_delete` events for the **Comment** model. It ensures that the relevant cache keys are cleared whenever a comment or reply is added or deleted, thus keeping the data fresh in the admin profile view.
